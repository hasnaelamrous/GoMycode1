  <h1> About </h1>
  <p> The World Wide Web (WWW), often called the Web, is a system of interconnected webpages and information that you can access using the Internet. It was created to help people share and find information easily, using links that connect different pages together. The Web allows us to browse websites, watch videos, shop online, and connect with others around the world through our computers and phones.

   All public websites or web pages that people may access on their local computers and other devices through the internet are collectively known as the World Wide Web or W3. Users can get further information by navigating to links interconnecting these pages and documents. This data may be presented in text, picture, audio, or video formats on the internet.  </p>
